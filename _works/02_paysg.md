# The Problem #

  Every time a government agency wants to collect payments, look for vendors to help them set up a whole site, build a payment form and related infrastructure. How might we empower government agencies to set up payment links? How might we make the payment experience a positive and quick experience for citizens?

# The Research #

We interviewed a few agencies and found out that most agencies spend months spec-ing out what they want to build and it is usually challenging for them to navigate the technology space to build good system that can handle payments reliably. They don't really know the different payment providers and their product offering. 

Reconciliation of the money collected is also an important part of such system to make sure every cent is accounted for. We also noticed that for the smaller agencies, this process is so costly and time-consuming, and they will just stick with the old way of to collecting money over the counter and have people fill up paper forms instead. 

Therefore, it makes a lot of sense for a government tech team to do this heavy lifting for them. If we can build a system that they can easily set up payment links, process credit card and debit card payments, track these transactions on a dashboard, it is already a big win. What's more, we have some experience implementing [Parking.sg](http://parking.sg), leveraging on Stripe's reliable payments system, we have some sense of the space and scope we are dealing with.

# Minimal Viable Product #

In January 2020, we build the first version of Pay.gov.sg. It could generate a payment link from a dashboard and we showcased it a few government agencies. However, Covid hit, and we were reallocated to other projects. In the MVP, the user was able to create a generic form with payment information for 1 item, use Stripe as checkout and have these transaction reflect on a very minimal dashboard. It was a 

# The Pivot #

In June 2020, when Singapore wanted open its borders to travellers again, the government needed a way to collect payments for COVID Swab Tests and accommodation for Stay Home Notices (SHN). This use case involves multiple agencies as the incoming profiles include students, employers paying on behalf of returning employees, and foreigners of different types of employment passes and needs. 

The system needs to be up and running in less than 2 weeks and we need to make it work! 

# My Role #

I was the lead designer. I did all the design work (branding, visual design, ui design) and the frontend styling of the landing page, email templates for payment notice notice and receipt. 

# My Team #

5 people in total (i.e. 1 Product Manager, 3 Developers and 1 Designer). We also worked with public servants at the various government agencies for the operational details. 

# Development Timeline #

The MVP was done in 2 weeks and the entire rebuilt of the COVID payments variant was done in another 2 weeks.
