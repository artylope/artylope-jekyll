# The Problem #

  The daily commute on the public transport can get stressful. We were interested to find out if on-demand buses could be an answer to the problem. The data scientists in my team analysed and visualised EZLink data in the heat map below. It shows that commuters staying in the red zones take much longer time to travel from their home to anywhere in Singapore during the peak hours. This could be an opportunity for express buses.

# The Opportunity #
What if we could run on-demand express buses? Something that is cheaper than taxi, faster than the public bus. Coupled with optimised routing using data analytics and booking via smart phones, will it be possible? Will this improve commuter experience?

# The Solution #
We developed a platform called Beeline to match commuters to private bus operators. The Beeline app allows users to suggest and activate bus routes, book tickets and track them on the day of the ride. On the other end, Beeline empowers transport companies to gather demand, plan routes, manage and improve their services.

Beeline Suite includes:

###### Beeline Suite of Tools ######

- Commuter App for ticket booking, tracking buses and making route suggestions
- Bus Driver App for reporting location
- Admin Portal for booking admin, operations, finance and reporting purpose
- Monitoring tool for real time monitoring of bus fleet
- Analytics Tool for bus planning based on suggestions

I will be describing the the major milestones and the development journey below.

# My Role #
Lead Designer. User Research, Prototyping, Wireframing, User Testing, UX Design, UI Design, Service Design, Product Strategy, Product Management (during 1st version of the product)

# The Team #
Many people worked on Beeline over the course of 3 years. But at any one time, there is 1 Product Manager, 3 Developers and 1 Designer. I worked on this project as the lead designer since its inception and through all the different phases and product revamps during the 3 year. The development team also does marketing, customer support, operations and training at times since the product and service was developed from ground up. We behave like a start up even though we are in the government.

# Getting a Minimal Viable Product #
In the beginning, we do not know if commuters will be willing to pay more for an express bus ride. And we had no idea how we could reach them.
With the anonymised EZLink data, we could identify potential routes, but we could not identify the potential customers. So we set up a landing site in April 2015 to collect suggestions and public feedback about their commuting preferences. People were interested and we collected many suggestions.

# Running the first bus #
In the next 4 months, we quickly developed a commuter app that can allow users to book tickets and a driver app that could ping GPS location.
We managed to convince a bus operator, Aedge Holdings, to prototype with us. We ran our first buses for the public in August 2015.

###### This is us doing testing on the roads with the drivers ######

# Empowering Operations Manager #
Traditionally, the ops manager managing the fleet of buses have no way to tell if the bus drivers pick up their passengers on time unless someone complains. The ops manager could on the road when the buses are running during peak hour. Therefore, he needs something that can work on his phone that can give him an overview of his fleet and let him respond during emergencies. After understanding what information can help him, we developed a web app for them to monitor their fleet.

# Reinventing Beeline #
In Dec 2015, 5 months into running Beeline, we couldn't fill our buses. We also only had 2 bus operators and they were not keen to run more routes. They would rather get chartered businesses from corporate clients than take risks in new technology and uncommitted commuters. We had the chicken and egg problem.
<div><img src="/img/works_beeline/beeline_innovationlab.png"></div>
###### Innovation Lab ######

With the help of a fellow design facilitator, Lam Yishan, we conducted a full day innovation workshop to get the team to evaluate our learnings.
2 major ideas came out of this innovation lab and the subsequent discussions and prototyping.
1. What if we could get people to commit money to activate bus routes instead of just submitting suggestions?
2. What if we could gather all free shuttle buses on Beeline so people can find and track them easily?

# Beyond Suggestions #
One of the issues Beeline faced was that people are very keen to suggest since suggesting requires no commitment. However, when the bus route starts, not many people will take it. We came up with a mechanism that behaves like kickstarter to let commuters commit money. When enough people commit to buying tickets, the bus operator will activate a route.

# Getting more users and bus operators #
In the effort to get more people and bus operators to try Beeline, we came up with prototype called Lite Routes. It leverages on Beeline's capability to let commuters track buses. We approached many companies providing free buses to list on Beeline. They liked Beeline because we provided them a way to make drivers accountable. In terms of UI, I had to remove booking and optimise the listing for loop services.

###### Lite Routes are routes that are for tracking only, no booking required. ######

# The Future of Mobility #
As we developed Beeline, we are constantly improving and optimising it. There are many factors that needs to be ready before buses can be truly on-demand. Some of these include data being analysed and clustered real-time and autonomous vehicles being deployed automatically after receiving the passenger lists. This could seem idealistic, but I hope this can come true one day.

# Mobility as a service #
Imagine someday where there are so many transport options and yet there is a marketplace that matches commuter's preferences quickly to the suitable transport mode. Yet again, this requires all transport systems being ready to be plugged to this network.

# Reception #
Currently, Beeline runs **200 express bus routes** monthly and is **adopted by major companies** (e.g. Grab, SMRT, Comfort Delgro, JTC, Wildlife Reserve Singapore) to sell bus tickets and monitor their fleet. As of Oct 2018, it has **50k monthly active users**. Transport organisations from other countries also consult Beeline on our experience and learnings.

# Final Thoughts #
Beeline started as an experiment to prototype on-demand buses. It evolved into a full suite of tools that bridges a jarring gap in the private bus industry 4 years ago- the need for digitisation to improve service delivery. More importantly, it also provided commuters a way to start their own bus routes. As a designer, I am deeply thankful for this opportunity to be able to dream and create a product and service from scratch, and carried it through all the way up to its fruition.
