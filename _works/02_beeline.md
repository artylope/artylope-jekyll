# The Problem #

  The daily commute on the public transport can get stressful. We were interested to find out if on-demand buses could be an answer to the problem. The data scientists in my team analysed and visualised EZLink data in the heat map below. It shows that commuters staying in the red zones take much longer time to travel from their home to anywhere in Singapore during the peak hours. This could be an opportunity for express buses.

# The Opportunity #
What if we could run on-demand express buses? Something that is cheaper than taxi, faster than the public bus. Coupled with optimised routing using data analytics and booking via smart phones, will it improve commuter experience?

# The Solution #
We developed a platform called Beeline to match commuters to private bus operators. The Beeline app allows users to suggest and activate bus routes, book tickets and track them on the day of the ride. On the other end, Beeline empowers transport companies to manage and operate their fleet.

Beeline Suite includes:

- Commuter App for ticket booking, tracking buses and making route suggestions
- Bus Driver App for reporting location
- Admin Portal for operations, finance and reporting purpose
- Monitoring tool for real time monitoring of bus fleet
- Analytics Tool for bus planning based on suggestions

I will be describing the the major milestones and the development journey below.

# My Role #
Lead Designer. User Research, Prototyping, Wireframing, User Testing, UX Design, UI Design, Service Design, Product Strategy, Product Management (during 1st version of the product)

# The Team #
Many people worked on Beeline over the course of 3 years. But at any one time, there is 1 Product Manager, 3 Developers and 1 Designer. I worked on this project as the lead designer since its inception and through all the different phases and product revamps during the 3 year. The development team also does marketing, customer support, operations and training at times since the product and service was developed from ground up. We behave like a start up even though we are in the government.

# Minimal Viable Product #
In the beginning, we do not know if commuters will be willing to pay more for an express bus ride. And we had no idea how we could reach them.
With the anonymised EZLink data, we could identify potential routes, but we could not identify the potential customers. So we set up a landing site to collect suggestions and public feedback about their commuting preferences.

Getting routes suggestions and forming a viable route.
# Running the first bus #
# Making drivers accountable #
Being able to track the bus on the day of the ride is
As some of the drivers only understood Chinese, we also included a Chinese mode for them.
Of course there was a lot of resistance from the drivers initially. The bus companies had to find ways to incentivise good drivers and penalise bad drivers. They didn't have a way to tell definitely, now they do.

# Empowering the Ops Manager #
Traditionally, the ops manager of managing the fleet of buses have no way to tell if bus drivers pick up their passengers on time. In the worst cases, they are the last to find out when the commuters call the bus company to complain about the missing bus. Fortunately, Beeline drivers send location pings via the Beeline Driver App to their passengers, we can display this information to the ops manager as well. In this case, other than showing if the buses are operating as expected, ops managers can also alert the ops manager when the driver is not sending pings, so that the ops manager can send messages to commuters about bus cancellation in the worst scenario.

# The Future of Mobility #
<div><img src="/img/works_beeline/beeline_futureofmobility.svg"></div>

# Reception #
Currently, Beeline runs **200 express bus routes** monthly and is **adopted by major companies** (e.g. Grab, SMRT, Comfort Delgro, JTC, Wildlife Reserve Singapore) to sell bus tickets and monitor their fleet. As of Oct 2018, it has **50k monthly active users**. Transport organisations from other countries also consult Beeline on our experience and learnings.

# Final Thoughts #
Beeline started as an experiment to prototype on-demand buses. It evolved into a full suite of tools that bridges a jarring gap in the private bus industry 4 years ago- the need for digitisation to improve service delivery. More importantly, it also provided commuters a way to start their own bus routes. As a designer, I am deeply thankful for this opportunity to be able to dream and create a product and service from scratch, and carried it through all the way up to its fruition.
