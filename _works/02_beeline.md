# The Problem #
  The daily commute on the public transport can get stressful for some. We were interested to find out if on-demand buses could be an answer to the problem. The data scientists in my team analysed and visualised the EZLink data. Pockets of underserved areas surfaced. The heat map below shows that commuters staying in the red zones take much longer time to travel from their home to anywhere in Singapore during the peak hours. We see this as an opportunity for express buses to run.

###### Commuters staying in the red zones take the most time to travel during the peak hour. ######

# The Solution #
In August 2015, we released the Beeline app that allows users to book tickets on express bus routes. During the 3 years, Beeline is developed into a suite of tools for transport companies to improve commuter experience. Major innovation includes public route suggestions and clustering capability, ticket booking, bus tracking and monitoring, and a "crowdstarting" mechanism to activate new bus routes.

Beeline Suite of Tools:

- Commuter App for ticket booking, tracking buses and making suggestions
- Bus Driver App for reporting location
- Admin Portal for operations, finance and reporting purpose
- Monitoring tool for real time monitoring of bus fleet
- Analytics Tool for bus planning based on suggestions

I will be describing the development journey below.

# My Role #
Lead Designer. User Research, Prototyping, Wireframing, User Testing, User Interface Design, Trial Set Up, Product Strategy, Product Management (during 1st version of the product)

# The Team #
Many people worked on Beeline over the course of 3 years. But at any one time, there is 1 Product Manager, 3 Developers and 1 Designer. I worked on this project as the lead designer since its inception and through all the different phases. There have been 2 major product revamps during the 3 year. The team had to do marketing, customer support, operations and training at times due to the nature of the product.

# Where to run the buses #
Public transport commute involves transfers. Savings in travelling time if shuttle bus runs. Enough people travelling in the same 15-30 mins windows

# Who will take the buses #
Even though the ezLink data showed that there was demand for certain routes during the morning peak, there was no way we could reached out directly to these people and we were not sure if they will be interested to switch shuttle bus costing $5-6 per trip. We put out a site to collect route suggestions and emails to compare with our potential route data.

We also tried putting out flyers

# Getting bus drivers up to speed #
Unlike drivers in the private hire industry, bus drivers are not used to having their locations being tracked. They run on fixed routes and tend to be more adverse to change. We developed a driver app and continue iterating with them. As some of the drivers only know Chinese, we introduce a Chinese mode in the driver app as well. They check in using the app

# Reception #
Currently, Beeline runs 200 express bus routes monthly and is adopted by major companies (e.g. Grab, SMRT, Comfort Delgro, JTC, Wildlife Reserve Singapore) to sell tickets and monitor their fleet. As of Oct 2018, it has 50k monthly active users.


# Final Thoughts #
 Beeline started as an experiment to prototype on-demand buses. Although this current version of Beeline is far from being truly on-demand, it bridge a jarring gap that was lacking in the private bus industry 3 years ago- the need for digitisation to improve service delivery. More importantly, it provided commuters a way to start their own bus routes - a glimpse into what the future of mobility can be. As a designer, it was a great opportunity for me to be able to dream and create a product and service from scratch, and carried it through all the way up to its fruition.
