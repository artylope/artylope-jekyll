# The Problem #

  The daily commute on the public transport can get stressful for some. We were interested to find out if on-demand buses could be an answer to the problem. The data scientists in my team analysed and visualised the EZLink data. Pockets of underserved areas surfaced. The heat map below shows that commuters staying in the red zones take much longer time to travel from their home to anywhere in Singapore during the peak hours. This could be an opportunity for express buses.

###### Commuters staying in the red zones take the most time to travel during the peak hour. ######

# The Solution #
In August 2015, we released the Beeline app that allows users to book tickets on express bus routes. During the 3 years, Beeline is developed into a suite of tools for transport companies to improve commuter experience. Major innovation includes public route suggestions and clustering capability, ticket booking, bus tracking and monitoring, and a "crowdstarting" mechanism to activate new bus routes.

Beeline Suite of Tools:

- Commuter App for ticket booking, tracking buses and making suggestions
- Bus Driver App for reporting location
- Admin Portal for operations, finance and reporting purpose
- Monitoring tool for real time monitoring of bus fleet
- Analytics Tool for bus planning based on suggestions

I will be describing the development journey below.

# My Role #
Lead Designer. User Research, Prototyping, Wireframing, User Testing, User Interface Design, Trial Set Up, Product Strategy, Product Management (during 1st version of the product)

# The Team #
Many people worked on Beeline over the course of 3 years. But at any one time, there is 1 Product Manager, 3 Developers and 1 Designer. I worked on this project as the lead designer since its inception and through all the different phases. There had been 2 major product revamps during the 3 year. The team had to do marketing, customer support, operations and training at times due to the nature of the product.

# The Future of Mobility #

# Reception #
Currently, Beeline runs **200 express bus routes** monthly and is **adopted by major companies** (e.g. Grab, SMRT, Comfort Delgro, JTC, Wildlife Reserve Singapore) to sell tickets and monitor their fleet. As of Oct 2018, it has **50k monthly active users**. Transport organisations from other countries also consult Beeline on our experience and learnings.

# Final Thoughts #
Beeline started as an experiment to prototype on-demand buses. Although this current version of Beeline is far from being truly on-demand, it bridge a jarring gap that was lacking in the private bus industry 4 years ago- the need for digitisation to improve service delivery. More importantly, it provided commuters a way to start their own bus routes. It gives a glimpse into what the future of mobility can be. As a designer, it was a great opportunity for me to be able to dream and create a product and service from scratch, and carried it through all the way up to its fruition.
