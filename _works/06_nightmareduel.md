# Overview #
Nightmare Duel is conceptualised and developed during the time I was at Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab. Nightmare Duel is a fast-paced local multiplayer duel on the iPad that challenges the playersâ€™ reflex and control.

# My Role #
Game Artist. Game Art, User Interface Design, User Experience Design, Concept Art, Heads Up Display (HUD) and Environment Design, Visual Effects, Video Trailer Production and Editing.

There were 2 artists. I focused more on the UI, environment and visual effects while the other artist, Jasmine Phong, focused more on 3D models, in game visual effects and animation.

# The Team #
Team of 6 people. 1 Game Designer, 2 Artists, 2 Programmers, 1 Sound Designer.

# Prototyping #


# Environment Visual Development #
For the game environment and heads up display, it was important that the game feedback was clear but yet does not overwhelm the players as there was a lot going in the game. The background especially must not overpower the characters but it must be contrasting enough to communicate the boundaries of the tap zones. Here are some mock ups of possible environment UI designs.
