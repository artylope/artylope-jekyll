# Overview #

  One Upon Light is conceptualised and developed during the time I was at SUTD Game Lab. One Upon Light is a puzzle game where players must manipulate their surroundings in order to stay out of the light and remain in the shadows. Here is the trailer.

# The Team #
  Main Team of 7 people. 1 Game Designer, 2 Artists, 3 Programmers, 1 QA and an audio team. I worked as an artist. My fellow artists focused more on 3D Modelling, Effects and Animation, while I focused more on the 2D elements (e.g. user interface, textures, concept art etc)

# Prototyping #
During the early stage of development, we only knew we wanted a game that has to do with light and shadows, so  we needed to figure out what the game mechanics will be. We made different prototypes. Prototypes allow users to try out the game to see what works and what didn't. Here are some prototypes.

# Visual Development #
The game is about avoiding lights and casting shadows to create paths. To support the gameplay, the visual contrast between light areas and shadow areas has to be strong enough to make it clear for the players between safe and danger zones. To emphasise further the importance and danger of the light, we used the monochrome style to avoid “noise” from colours and keep the focus on the elements of lights and shadows.

# User Testing #
