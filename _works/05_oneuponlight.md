# Overview #
One Upon Light is conceptualised and developed during the time I was at SUTD Game Lab. One Upon Light is an indie puzzle game where players must manipulate their surroundings in order to **stay out of the light** and **remain in the shadows**.

# My Role #
Game Artist. Game Art, User Interface Design, User Experience Design, Character Design, Concept Art, 2D Textures, Environment Design, Website Design and Development, Video Trailer Production and Editing.

There were 2 artists. I focused more on the 2D elements (e.g. user interface, model textures, concept art etc), video and website while the other artist, Simon Strauss, focused more on 3D models, in game visual effects and animation.

# The Team #
Team of 7 people. 1 Game Designer, 2 Artists, 3 Programmers, 1 QA and an audio team.

# Prototyping #
During the early stage of development, we only knew we wanted a game that has to do with light and shadows, so  we needed to figure out what the game mechanics will be. We made different prototypes. Prototypes allow users to try out the game to see what works and what didn't. Here are some prototypes made by the Game Designer.

# Visual Development #
The game is about avoiding lights and casting shadows to create paths. To support the gameplay, the visual contrast between light areas and shadow areas has to be strong enough to make it clear for the players between safe and danger zones. We used the monochrome style to avoid “noise” from colours and keep the focus on the elements of lights and shadows. This way, we can emphasise the importance and danger of the light,  

I did the following concepts and art work.

# User Testing #
Here is a photo of a user playtesting the game. We conduct playtesting to validate if the game is fun and if any parts of the game makes it confusing for the user.

# User Interface Design #
User interfaces for games tends to focus on visual storytelling. It must encapsulate the mood and style that the game has. However, usability is still important. The same principles like immediacy of feedback still applies. It must also be consistent throughout the game so that they don't have to re-learn concepts and controls.

I did the following UI design and assets.

###### The Game UI is designed to be like chapters in a book ######

# Final Thoughts #
Making One Upon Light was one of the more artistic endeavour that I have attempted. I was able to apply design principles at a more visceral level. How can we lead a player through the game level and interface with a pure monochrome palette. How can we surprise the player as well as communicate clearly which are safe paths and where are the danger zones. It was a rewarding experience for me as an artist/designer.
