<h1 id="theproblem">The Problem</h1>

<p>Since the 1980s, motorists in Singapore who park their vehicles in public car parks, have to tear pre-paid paper coupons to pay for parking. Many of the car parks have since implemented the electronic gantries (aka Electronic Parking System EPS). However, there are about a thousand car parks in Singapore that still require motorists to use parking coupons instead. These could be the roadside parking lots or the smaller carparks that does not warrant the high cost of installing and long term maintenance of the EPS. Motorists need to stock up coupons and tear many pieces if they were to park for a long period of time. If they want to extend parking, they will have to run back to their vehicle to tear more coupons.</p>

<p>We wanted to develop a digital parking system that can replace the paper coupons, to give citizens the convenience of being able to pay for parking easily and extend parking remotely.</p>

<h1 id="thesolution">The Solution</h1>

<p>In October 2017, we released Parking.sg, a mobile app that allows motorists in Singapore pay for parking charges using their mobile phones at all coupon-based public car parks. The app has these 3 main features.
 1. Automatically calculate parking fees.
 2. Extend parking session
 3. Get refunds when you end the session early</p>

<p>How did we arrive at this solution? I will cover the highlights of the journey from discovery to production.</p>

<p>8 people in total, 3&#8211;4 at any one time (i.e. 1 Product Manager, 2 Developers and 1 Designer) We also worked with public servants in car park operations at the various government agencies. A Visual Designer polish the UI before the final launch. I did the rest of the design work.</p>

<p>10 months from prototype to full public launch in Oct 2017. Ongoing iteration and development there after.</p>

<h1 id="interviewingtheusers">Interviewing the users</h1>

<p>I prepared the following interview questions and interviewed several people who drive and uses the parking coupons. These are what they say, think and do.</p>

<h1 id="mappingouttheuserjourney">Mapping out the user journey</h1>

<p>With that information, I plotted this customer journey map to visualise the highlights and pain points of a motorist&#8217;s parking journey. Looking for parking and paying for parking create the most hassle for the user.

<h1 id="whataretheothercitiesdoingaboutthisproblem">What are the other cities doing about this problem?</h1>

<p>Many cities have tried to address the parking problem. Some of these are initiated by the local governments, while others are solutions from the carpark owners. I collected the screenshots and compared the features that these solutions have.</p>

<p>Digitising parking will not only benefit the citizens in terms of looking and paying for parking. The government will also have data for actual car park utilisation and this can be used for better resource planning.</p>

<p>With all the discovery and learning from above, I made this prototype in Sketch and InVision and brought it out for some Guerilla testing.

<p>The developers made a working prototype with a simple backend for pitching to the public agencies who manages the carparks. Our goal here is to convince them to let us trial the parking app at some car parks with actual users and enforcement officers.</p>

<p>To help us understand the enforcement process and we can integrate with the enforcement systems, we walked the ground with the enforcement officers.
