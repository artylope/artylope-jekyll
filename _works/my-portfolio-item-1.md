# The Project #
## The Problem ##

  In Singapore, when motorists park their vehicles in public car parks, they have to tear pre-paid paper coupons to pay for parking. This is cumbersome for the users. They need to stock up coupons and tear many pieces if they were to park for a long period of time. If they want to extend parking, they will have to run back to their vehicle to tear more coupons.

  We wanted to develop a digital parking system that can replace paper coupons. This solution must also integrate with the existing parking enforcement infrastructure.
