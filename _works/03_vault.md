# The Problem #
  Since the 1980s, motorists in Singapore who park their vehicles in public car parks, have to tear pre-paid paper coupons to pay for parking. Many of the car parks have since implemented the electronic gantries (aka Electronic Parking System EPS). However, there are about a thousand car parks in Singapore that still require motorists to use parking coupons instead. These could be the roadside parking lots or the smaller carparks that does not warrant the high cost of installing and long term maintenance of the EPS. Motorists need to stock up coupons and tear many pieces if they were to park for a long period of time. If they want to extend parking, they will have to run back to their vehicle to tear more coupons.

  We wanted to develop a digital parking system that can replace the paper coupons, to give citizens the convenience of being able to pay for parking easily and extend parking remotely.

# The Solution #
  In October 2017, we released Parking.sg, a mobile app that allows motorists in Singapore pay for parking charges using their mobile phones at all coupon-based public car parks. The app has these 3 main features.
  1. Automatically calculate parking fees.
  2. Extend parking session
  3. Get refunds when you end the session early

  How did we arrive at this solution? I will cover the highlights of the journey from discovery to production.
