# The Problem #
  All government agencies have their own IT systems, databases and processes around sharing of data. This makes sharing of data between government agencies for analysis and policy review challenging. I am involved in a project to improve the current data sharing infrastructure within the whole of government. I can't share the details of this project but I can share the high level discovery, challenges and solutions we came up for the project.

# The Solution #
  In October 2017, we released Parking.sg, a mobile app that allows motorists in Singapore pay for parking charges using their mobile phones at all coupon-based public car parks. The app has these 3 main features.
  1. Automatically calculate parking fees.
  2. Extend parking session
  3. Get refunds when you end the session early

  How did we arrive at this solution? I will cover the highlights of the journey from discovery to production.

# The Team #
8 people in total, 3-4 at any one time (i.e. 1 Product Manager, 2 Developers and 1 Designer) We also worked with public servants in car park operations at the various government agencies. A Visual Designer polish the UI before the final launch. I did the rest of the design work.
