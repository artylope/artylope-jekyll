# Directive

These are directives - ng-app, ng-controller, ng-repeat, and ng-src. Directives bind behavior to HTML elements. When the app runs, AngularJS walks through each HTML element looking for directives. When it finds one, AngularJS triggers that behaviour (like attaching a scope or looping through an array).
