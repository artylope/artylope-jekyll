I am currently learning Javascript using Watch and Code. This is more of a notebook if I need to refer.
Watch and code is really good if you want to learn vanilla JS. I have done the javascript courses on Codeacademy but Watch and code really put things into context of why we learn arrays, functions etc. And it is free!

  ```js
  //this is an array
  var todos = ['item 1','item 2', 'item 3']; //array
  console.log(todos);

  //add an item
  todos.push('item 4');
  console.log(todos);

  //change an item
  todos[2] = 'item new';
  console.log(todos);

  //delete an item in the array
  // splice(position of where u want to delete stuff,number of item to delete)
  //splice (0,1) will delete from the 1st item in the list and only 1 item ;

  todos.splice(0,1)
  console.log(todos);
```
