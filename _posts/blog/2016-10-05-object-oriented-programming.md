# Object Oriented Programming

Classes Prototype what can a class do or not do, that is the job of the prototype. our `Dog` constructor ensures that the `Dog` prototype has a `breed` property. Remember, the `Dog` prototype keeps track of what `Dog` has, doesn't have, can, or can't do. What is class, prototype, constructor, method, function, property what the heck.
