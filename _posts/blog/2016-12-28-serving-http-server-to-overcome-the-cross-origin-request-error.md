# Serving http-server to overcome the cross origin request error

Doing HTTP request from a page servedÂ as is will sometimes result in this error in the console.

> Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.

To overcome this, you can set up a local host or serve to gh-pages or any web server. First install http-server using npm into the folder

  1. In Terminal, cd into the project folder I want to serve

        ```
         $cd folder/folder/folder
        ```

  2. In that folder, type this to install http-server

        ```
        npm install http-server
        ```

  3. Then serve

        ```
        $ http-server -c-1
        ```
        
    // This means not caching the local server

or http-server the file you want to set up localhost for.


    $ http-server folder/folder/
