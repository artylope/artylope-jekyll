# Command line for Mac to see which ports are in use and how to end them

To list all the activities in Terminal, type 
    
    
    ps aux

To find the corresponding process ID (PID) of the specific port (e.g. 4000) 
    
    
     sudo lsof -n -i :4000 | grep LISTEN

Â  To kill the process, use the command below, replace the PID with the identified PID 
    
    
    kill -9 PID
