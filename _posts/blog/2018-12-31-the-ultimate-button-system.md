I find myself making these buttons over and over again in Sketch so I decided to make them into a library.
The buttons symbols has flexible width and can be customised into various forms just by tweaking the parameters in the sidebar. Most importantly, they require no plugins. These parameters include

1. Large, regular, small sizes
2. Label only, label with icons, icons only
3. Various colours
4. Block Colors, Outline or Link only variants.

This is made possible by the following article
[Sketch hacks: Make a Resizable button with Icon & Label, totally native edition](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/sketch-hacks-make-a-resizable-button-with-icon-label-totally-native-edition-6a1ff5b48e0e). This is a god-send because making a resizable button with label and icon centralised is really tough to do, ask any Sketch user.
