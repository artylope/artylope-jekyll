# Classes

The start of the Object-oriented programming! 
    
    
    function Person(name,age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }
    
    // Let's make bob again, using our constructor
    var bob = new Person("Bob Smith", 30);
    var susan = new Person("Susan Jordan", 35);
    
    // make your own class here
    // Make your own class, Circle, by building a constructor for it
    function Circle(radius){
        this.radius = radius;
        }
