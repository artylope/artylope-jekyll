<p><a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3064420/how-visual-designers-can-keep-their-jobs-in-a-post-screen-world"> https://www.fastcodesign.com/3064420/how-visual-designers-can-keep-their-jobs-in-a-post-screen-world</a> How to chart my Design Career The imminent rise of non-visual interfaces - chat bots (although I think this is a fad that will past once people figures out the ones below) - voice commands - virtual reality - wearables and sensors Learning how to code for the past 2 weeks Distracted me from design Tried to jump back to design but all I could think was code. I dream about the console log, declaring variables and making functions. I am afraid of losing my design sensibilities because I hang out with developers and data scientists much more than I hang out with designers. With design, I feel a strong sense of imposter syndrome, there is so much to learn and know but I only get to apply some of what I think I know. Everytime I read about articles about design thinking creative processes and building innovative teams, I feel inadequate. How can they so clearly articulate their minds about such an abstract and ambiguous process. I admire them. For me, I just do the most intuitive, immediate task to me. be it test the concept or build out a prototype just to try.</p>
