# Prototyping

My goto workflow currently sketches -> high-fidelity mocks in Sketch -> InVision -> Code and anytime I need iterations, update Sketch and update InVision. InVision is page based. Great for fast, high-level flow and interactions. Been wanting to explore more layer based prototyping for micro-interactions, which is a lot more work. (this requires more details and effort than necessary for the type of work I am doing) Anyway, this article gives a very good coverage of the available layer based prototyping - [http://www.sketchappsources.com/blog/post/app-prototyping-tools-compared ](http://www.sketchappsources.com/blog/post/app-prototyping-tools-compared) Think I will explore Framer more (but need to learn coffeeScript) and Principle, yet to put down money for it. Go go go! Do it!
