# Starting on Free Code Camp - Javascript

Some important concept Copied from Free Code Camp... 

> In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters. MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature. Best Practice Write variable names in Javascript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
