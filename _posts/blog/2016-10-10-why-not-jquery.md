# Why not JQuery?

So now that I am slightly familiar with the power of JQuery, it is time to revisit the don't learn JQuery arguments. Â The whys are the parts I wanted to understand but couldn't appreciate due to ignorance of the subject matter. So summary - JQuery is a library that developers are relying too much on. It is additional bloat that is unnecessary especially since modern browsers have started to support most of the methods commonly use. AJAX, DOM manipulation etc. So now I need to go back to learn the Vanilla JS way. Meanwhile... all the "You don't need JQuery" articles. <http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/> <http://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/> http://lea.verou.me/2015/04/jquery-considered-harmful/ <http://blog.wearecolony.com/a-year-without-jquery/> <https://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-vs-raw-javascript-1-dom-forms/> http://tutorialzine.com/2014/06/10-tips-for-writing-javascript-without-jquery/
