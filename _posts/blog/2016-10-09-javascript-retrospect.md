# Javascript Retrospect

So up till now what i know about Javascript \- there is the logic part, the parts on control flow, maths, functions and objects, which I will need when I manipulate data to display to front end. \- then there is the part where I control the DOM. the HTML Part \- then there is also the part that controls the CSS \- both of which there is JQuery library and JQuery UI library that speeds it up if not we can always use the javascript function like getElementbyID stuff. \- then there is the part that i haven't learn - the APIs, Ajax and JSONs Other stuff I would like to try \- form validation \- UI and DOM manipulation by pure JS, no jquery \- the data APIs, display of data from API and possibly DB stuff? \- Google and OSM maps \- d3.js \- maybe angular and react? \- mustache.js and handlebars \- webpack bower gulp grunt builders http://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/
